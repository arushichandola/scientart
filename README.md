# 🧮 Mathematica Visuals — Creative Code + Geometry

**Blending Mathematics, Physics into computational visuals and much more through Wolfram Mathematica!**

Welcome to my collection of visuals created with **Wolfram Mathematica**, where I explore mathematical structures, recursion, parametric design, and creative coding.

These pieces reflect a fusion of computation and aesthetics — often called **scientart** or **math art**.
